# Space-RPG
My space RPG

Steps:
1: First download all files in the File folder
2: Next run the .exe file titled "Space RPG"
3: You'll get a popup from windows security wanring you about a threat, don't worry as I'm not smart enough to make malware yet, click "more info" then "run anyways"
4: Enjoy, and let me know of any bugs/balance concerns you have. As well as any suggestions for what can be improved/new features.

Features currently missing:
1: Ground combat. You will be notified you are being boarded and nothing else as of now
2: Cloaking Module. You can buy it but it won't do anything.
